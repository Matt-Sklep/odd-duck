# LAB - 11 for Code 201

## Odd Duck

This is a webpage that gives the user 3 random images (each of which are different to one another) for them to vote on. It tracks each time the user sees the image (views) and each time they click on it (vote). Once they go through 25 rounds of these images, they are given a results button that they can click to see these tracked values.

## LAB 12 UPDATES

Today's update had us prevent users from seeing the images of the previous round on the current round, as well as using myChart JS to nicely present our data for higher readability.
